# Logistic-Regression
This is a Logistic Regression performed on a dataset about Portugal bank marketing campaigns results that I found on Kaggle. The goal was to predict if a client agreed to place deposit after being contacted by the campaign.
I used Jupyter Notebook and the most important libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib and sklearn.
